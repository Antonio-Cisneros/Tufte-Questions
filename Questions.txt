1. Graphical excellence

- How do the substance properties of graph scope its display?
By revealing all significant data points and state the descriptions of the dataset.

- How graphical design affect data interpretation? 
By a misunderstanding in the data, and data complexity is inaccessible for the communication.

- Does inferential statistics avoid inferring the cleaning of a graph?
No, inferential statistics pretend to improve the sequence order of data.

- The abstraction of data graphs and charts are not always clear for the learners?
The space of the graph will affect learner's idea if the minimization of data-ink doesn't show the data.

-------------------------------------------------------

2. Graphical integrity

- Are misleading graphics can have unexpected changes in scale?
It depends if there is a lacking of quantitative skills and inferential statistics aren't consider or if the graph can't maintain the quantity visual correspondency.

- Is the annotation not always considered when developing a chart/graph?
The label must be clearly and detail if the analyst aims for sharing the main idea of the graph narrative and it avoids the distrution and ambiguity on a graph.

- Can anyone create a graph?
The issues of a graph always start if the person doesn't have a clear interpretation of raw data.

- Are illusions just non-gain quality to decrease the dimensions of data?

Yes, it only describes the minima optical performance in the design of charts and graphs, it only tends to deception the goal of the structure.

- Why the lie factor converges with the numerical measure?
Since both terms specify the consistency of charts and graphs where it will lead to demonstrate the proportions between the surface and the numerical quantities. 

-------------------------------------------------------

3. Sources of Graphical Integrity and Sophistication

- When are graphical casualties stated?
When there is a lack of quantitative skills, 
the graphic developer believe that statistical data is boring, 
and when the people to attract doesn't understand the data.

- Does design variation tend to establish graphic mediocrity?
Yes, it will describe how bad the develop/artist understand the data, and only wants to commit 
its unique design where constraint the audience of what the right meaning is.

- Why a better relational graphic displays a better sophistication?
It will describe how one variables affects another, since all is cause and effect 
the graphics visualize a better understand and purpose of communication the data.

- Which terms make graphical integrity and sophistication a union of complex operation?
The substance of the graph/chart, the right evidence of statistical data, and fodness of the artist with data variation.

--------------------------------------------------------

4. Data-Ink and Graphical Redesign

- What happen when the Data-Ink ratio is high?
There exist an exaggeration of similarities, deception of the data graphic, and misinterpretation of the data.

- Why does the 	principles of Editing and Redesign critice graphic structure?
Since it will change all visualization of the graphic, and it will lead to create an experimental design of the essential information.

- What are the benefits of erasing non-data ink?
It provides a better color of the graphic, the selection of color is better, and data can be distinguished.


- How does experiment design will assist the data-ink?
While simple is the graphic, it is hardest to interpret the visualization

---------------------------------------------------------

5. Chartjunk: Vibrations,  Grids, and Ducks

- How chart junk impact the comprehension?
It brings a no significance difference between a plain image and charts, where an the detail gap of the data is visualize. 

- What does it means Moir√© pattern?
The interference which is form when two line grid are overlapping with certain angle.

- Why chart junk provide additional information to the reader than may enhance comprehension? 
Redesinging a chart provide a higher significance on its messages and it state a better understanding of it.

- How "The Duck" provide the design in a graphic?
It display how the perspective of the chart is and how relevant is the information on it.

----------------------------------------------------------

6. Data-Ink Maximization and Graphical Design

- Why visualization of a graph must be considered if there is a fail or success on it?
Since it aims for the extraction of cognitive measures to identify the quantitative skills

- How does the range-frame describe the encoding of data-ink?
It is focused on the position of the horizontal line and the value of the data points.

- Where do it lead the erasing and editing in a scatter plot?
It goes to benefit the data exploratory analysis.

- Which is the harderst box plot to interprete its data?
A simple box plot, since the dot plot converge the data variation and the data-ink ratio will upon into the close to one.
----------------------------------------------------------

7. Multifunctioning Graphical Elements

- What can it be represented by the data measures?
It can represent multiple variables either quantitative or qualitative and based on the stem-leaf-plot, 
it makes the most effective display of data.

- What is the use of Chernoff's faces?
The faces are used as data points to display multivariate data.

- Why does it being use Double Functioning Labels?
The data-base labels are being opposed to rounded the number of data labels 
to shows the exact range of data points (maxima and minima).

- Which color scale is the better for multifunctioning graphics?
Grey scale.

-----------------------------------------------------------

8 - Data Density and Small Multiples

- What are small multiples and why they are cheap?
They are the chart sets which share the same graph metrics such as same scale, same type.
Those are represented in a minimal detail, often using grid for the explanation and are economical since if the viewer understand the data variation of one chart
it will understand the rest.

- How the small multiples could be interactived links?
By filtering the data, and when it's ready to be sorted and spot the data points which significance stand out among the rest.

- For what the Shrink principle is use?
Since it is method to maximize the data density, and the size of the data matrix by losing information.

- According to Tufte, how the spark-lines must be?
Data-intense, using a simple design and word-sized graphics.

-----------------------------------------------------------

9 - Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design

- What is often see refering to simplicity of design and complexity of data?
Graphical elegance.

- Why graphical architecture combines with the data content?
To approach a unique graphic where the metrics are well establish.

- Which factors determine the choice of method for the display of quantitative materials?
Substantive content, extensiveness of labels, and volume and ordering of data.

- What is the main idea of friendly graphic?
The simpler method to visualize it is the simpler method to understand it.
